        <h2>Code-Enabled Bootstrapper Focused on Oil & Gas</h2>
        <p>
          As a business owner with an engineering degree, MBA, and over a decade
          of analytical and marketing roles in the oil and gas industry, I have
          accumulated the knowledge to provide detailed industry news and
          research and built unique subscription databases which users will pay
          to access. Having completed a full-stack web development boot camp, I
          now have the programming toolkit to serve this information to my
          customers with the responsive analytics they value. I plan to grow my
          customer base of the smartest industry professionals and expand
          coverage by partnering with industry-leading companies and eventually
          hiring additional analysts.
